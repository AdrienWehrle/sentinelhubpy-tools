* Development Environment
+ These tools have been developed using a conda virtual environment that can be identically recreated. To this end, create a new      
  environment using [[./SICE_tools.yml]] as below:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash :results verbatim
  conda env create -f sentinelhubpy.yml
  #+END_SRC

* Tools description
** sentinelhub_automatic_download.py
+ Automated data download and processing using the Sentinel Hub Python API.  
+ Requests can be added to [[box_examples.csv]] with corresponding box boundaries (lat, lon) and time. 
+ Examples of version 3 custom scripts are provided. 
+ Possibility to extract existing custom scripts from the [[https://custom-scripts.sentinel-hub.com/][online collection of custom scripts]]. 
+ Requests are run using multiprocessing to drastically decrease computation time.
